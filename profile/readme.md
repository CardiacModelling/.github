# Cardiac Modelling Team
Team led by [Gary Mirams](https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/plp/pmzgm/), and based at the [Centre for Mathematical Medicine & Biology](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/cmmb/), [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/).

To find the repos associated with our papers, please see our list of publications which contains [a link for each publication](https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/plp/pmzgm/publications/).

In addition there are other pinned repos that we expect to be most useful, which may not be associated with papers, for instance:
* `RapidCharacterisationProtocols` for our latest protocols that characterise ion currents quickly and efficiently by providing rich information for training mathematical models.
* `fitting-notebooks` which give tutorials about how we would fit data from these protocols including lots of important detail on optimisation algorithms, parameter transforms, priors and more.
* `VoltageClampModel` which provides code to simulate voltage clamp artefacts, which can be added to any ion channel or action potential model to simulate realistic voltage clamp artefacts for use in forward and inverse problems involving comparison with real experimental data.
